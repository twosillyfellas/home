Hi, hello!
uh this is just a silly project under the title "two silly fellas"
refering to me and a friend and we just kinda fork github repos
and "mod" them ie make little to no changes or in this case this repo opens a
new tab with an about:blank so the teachers can't watch what we're doing and uh ig
the only downside is that you cant really use control/command z lol
